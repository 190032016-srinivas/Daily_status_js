functions value
function sayHi() {
  alert( "Hello" );
}
alert( sayHi ); // shows the function code
Please note that the last line does not run the function, because there are no parentheses after sayHi. There are programming languages where any mention of a function name causes its execution, but JavaScript is not like that.
In JavaScript, a function is a value, so we can deal with it as a value. The code above shows its string representation, which is the source code.

callback functions
function ask(question, yes, no) {
  if (confirm(question)) yes()
  else no();
}
function showOk() {
  alert( "You agreed." );
}
function showCancel() {
  alert( "You canceled the execution." );
}
// usage: functions showOk, showCancel are passed as arguments to ask
ask("Do you agree?", showOk, showCancel);

function expression vs declaration
// Function Declaration
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
// Function Expression
let sum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

A Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined.
