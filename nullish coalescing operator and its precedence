nullish coalescing operator
The nullish coalescing operator is written as two question marks ??.
The result of a ?? b is:
if a is defined, then a,
if a isn’t defined, then b.
In other words, ?? returns the first argument if it’s not null/undefined. Otherwise, the second one.
let user;
alert(user ?? "Anonymous"); // Anonymous (user is undefined)
let user = "John";
alert(user ?? "Anonymous"); // John (user is not null/undefined)
let firstName = null;
let lastName = null;
let nickName = "Supercoder";
// shows the first defined value:
alert(firstName ?? lastName ?? nickName ?? "Anonymous"); // Supercoder

comparision with or operator
The important difference between them is that:
|| returns the first truthy value.
?? returns the first defined value.
let height = 0;
alert(height || 100); // 100
alert(height ?? 100); // 0

precedence 
The precedence of the ?? operator is the same as ||
