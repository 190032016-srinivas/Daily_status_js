An operand – is what operators are applied to. For instance, in the multiplication of 5 * 2 there are two operands: the left operand is 5 and the right operand is 2. Sometimes, people call these “arguments” instead of “operands”.
An operator is unary if it has a single operand. For example, the unary negation - reverses the sign of a number:
string-concatination
let s = "my" + "string";
alert(s)

let apples = "2";
let oranges = "3";
// both values converted to numbers before the binary plus
alert( +apples + +oranges );


If an expression has more than one operator, the execution order is defined by their precedence, or, in other words, the default priority order of operators.
From school, we all know that the multiplication in the expression 1 + 2 * 2 should be calculated before the addition. That’s exactly the precedence thing. The multiplication is said to have a higher precedence than the addition.
