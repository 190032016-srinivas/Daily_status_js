The JavaScript language steadily evolves. New proposals to the language appear regularly, they are analyzed and, if considered worthy, 
are appended to the list at https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/ andthen progress to the specification.
Teams behind JavaScript engines have their own ideas about what to implement first. They may decide to implement proposals that are in 
draft and postpone things that are already in the spec, because they are less interesting or just harder to do.
As programmers, we’d like to use most recent features. The more good stuff – the better!
On the other hand, how to make our modern code work on older engines that don’t understand recent features yet?
There are two tools for that:
Transpilers.
Polyfills.

transpiler-
A transpiler is a special piece of software that translates source code to another source code. It can parse (“read and understand”) modern code and rewrite 
it using older syntax constructs, so that it’ll also work in outdated engines.
E.g. JavaScript before year 2020 didn’t have the “nullish coalescing operator” ??. So, if a visitor uses an outdated browser,
it may fail to understand the code like height = height ?? 100.
A transpiler would analyze our code and rewrite height ?? 100 into (height !== undefined && height !== null) ? height : 100.

polyfill:
New language features may include not only syntax constructs and operators, but also built-in functions.
For example, Math.trunc(n) is a function that “cuts off” the decimal part of a number, e.g Math.trunc(1.23) returns 1.
In some (very outdated) JavaScript engines, there’s no Math.trunc, so such code will fail.
As we’re talking about new functions, not syntax changes, there’s no need to transpile anything here. We just need to declare the missing function.
A script that updates/adds new functions is called “polyfill”. It “fills in” the gap and adds missing implementations.
For this particular case, the polyfill for Math.trunc is a script that implements it, like this:
if (!Math.trunc) { // if no such function
  // implement it
  Math.trunc = function(number) {
    // Math.ceil and Math.floor exist even in ancient JavaScript engines
    // they are covered later in the tutorial
    return number < 0 ? Math.ceil(number) : Math.floor(number);
  };
}
